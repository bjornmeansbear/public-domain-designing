# public-domain-designing
Quick little presentation and workshop to utilize more free/libre/open source and public domain stuff 

## Where to start.
So, copyright. Normally the way a designer interacts with copyright and licensing is adversarial; or perhaps secretive?

You don't want to steal or copy or anything; but you might end up doing it -- and then just hope no one notices?

One way to steer around some of these issues is by utilizing F/LOS fonts, images, tools, etc.

Another way is to head straight to the public domain itself!

Oh! vernacular designing?

Something that copyright prohibits, is easily building work on off other works.

Designers however do often look to other design to do this. Frequently, that design is of older origin -- sometimes much older! Typically this is referred to as vernacular design.

Vernacular means the language of a time and place; and originally was a term from linguistics. It has become more of an all purpose term and is applied to all aspects of language, fashion, architecture and design now...

~ So, if you want to make a cape cod house, no architect can sue you for ripping off their cape cod house -- I mean, reasonably -- cape cod houses are a vernacular style; the form of cape cods predates a lot of these kinds of rules. ~
